[Computation type:] Storage and querying of geospatial data, specified as
'Rectangle's.

[Useful for:] Storage and querying of geospatial data, specified as
'Rectangle's.

Defines the /Hilbert's RTree/ data structure. Used for storing geospatial data,
especially in data bases. It's a hybrid structure between the R-Tree and the
B+-tree. Uses the Hilbert's distance of the middle point of the stored
rectangles to establish an order relation over them. The implementation of this
module is based on the paper \'Hilbert R-tree: An Improved R-tree Using
Fractals\' (1994), by Ibrahim Kamel and Christos Faloutsos. It was developed as
an assignment for the course of \'Programaci&#243;n Funcional Avanzada -
CI-4251\' (Advanced Functional Programming - CI-4251) in the Universidad
Sim&#243;n Bol&#237;var, on the period April-July 2012, due to 2012-06-17 23:59
VET.
